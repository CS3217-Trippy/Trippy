# Trippy

Have you ever thought of traveling, but have no idea where you should go?
Maybe you wanted to be ambitious and go for a faraway location like visiting Saudi Arabian deserts or scaling the Himalayan mountains.
Maybe you just wanted to have a quick refresher and visit cool places near you that you havenâ€™t known before.
Are you also looking for like-minded people that share the same traveling passion like yours?
Are you looking for companions for your travels? Do you wish to build connections and gain new travel buddies?

We present to you Trippy, a solution for your travel problems.
Trippy is a social network for people to explore new places,
where tourists can use the app to explore different itineraries on their holidays especially those that are not well known,
while locals can also use the app to discover new places in their country and new ideas for where to go on their next outing/date.
Trippy is facilitated by the aggregation of community recommendations and a platform for people to plan trips with their friends to explore areas that they have not explored before.

This project is made as a final project for NUS CS3217 AY2019/2020.
